           <b>About Indira Gandhi Wildlife Sanctuary And National Park</b></p>
        <p>
           &nbsp;The Indira Gandhi Wildlife Santuary is located in the Western Ghats in Tamil Nadu and is named after former Prime Minister of India Indira Gandhi who visited it in 1961. Residing tribal communities include the Kadars, Malasars, Muduvars and Eravallan among others. The sanctuary gives a safe habitat to many endangered species of mammals like Bengal Tiger, lion-tailed macaque, Nilgiri langur, Indian leopard, Indian Pangolin, gaur, Indian giant squirrel etc. This place is a delight for bird watchers and photo fanatics because it is known to harbor over 250 species of birds. Also you can find here about 2000 species of plants some of them are very rare and even highly medicinal! Wet Evergreen forests,southern tropical moist deciduous forests, montane shola-grassland and thorn forests dominate. For the visitors the park has a large tourist complex having stay cottages and rooms. Most visitors choose to be accommodated at ‘Top Slip’. It is very important to educate kids about the depleting forest and wildlife cover of the Earth. Hence, you must get them here. They will have lots of adventure and be awed by the fact that nature has so much to offer. There is a moderate warm climate throughout the year here. However best time to visit may be December to April.&nbsp;</p>
