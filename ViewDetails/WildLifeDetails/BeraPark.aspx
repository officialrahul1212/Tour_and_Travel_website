        Jawai is nestled in Pali district of Rajastan and offers an offbeat getaway to tourists looking for scenic beauty, wildlife, and nature in rural India. Surely, hopping on a typical Jawai leopard safari is one of the most popular things to do in Jawai. However, you will be surprised to know that’s not the only crowd puller for this upcoming tourist hotspot.

</p>
    <p>
        Jawai bandh is being added to many Rajasthan itineraries and after spending 3 days in the leopard hills of Jawai, I can clearly see why. Jawai turned out to be a gem hiding in plain sight. Just a few hours away from popular tourist spots of Jodhpur and Udaipur, this stunning landscaped land is sure to take your breath away.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
        &nbsp;</p>
    <p>
        <img alt="" class="style2" src="../../TourismHUB/Packages/Images/bera1.jpg" /></p>
    <p>
        &nbsp;</p>
    <p>
        Due to their high density, it is fairly easy to spot them. If you take 2 to 3 leopard safaris and stay for around 3 days in Jawai, it is ideal to enjoy all the things this town has to offer whilst ensuring a sighting of this spotted cat.

</p>
    <p>
        Your safari driver would surely know the hot spots and caves leopards are currently around and the best times to spot them. All drivers are well connected and if anyone spots a leopard, it is most likely that all jeeps on tour on that day will spot it as well. Luckily, it’s not too crowded like having 20 jeeps in popular parks of Africa or India. You will enjoy an ‘almost’ exclusive leopard sighting if you are the first ones on the spot and lucky. If not, the maximum we saw was 4 other jeeps.

</p>
    <p>
        We were lucky enough to spot a leopard in our very first safari as it came out of the cave and lounged for over an hour in front of us. That was quite something!

</p>
    <p>
        Other animals you can spot here are hyenas, bears, crocodiles, and nilgai.&nbsp;</p>

        <b>Sight Leopards Throughout the Year</b> </p>
    <p>
Bera Wildlife Sanctuary can be visited in any month of the year. There is not any dense forests in the wildlife reserve. Instead of it, there are granite hills spread over the whole region. You will be having the high chances of sighting leopards in summer as well as winter.

</p>
    <p>
        In summer, you can sight the leopards in the evening time when they sit at hill tops after the sunset. At this time, you can also witness how leopards hunt for their food.

</p>
    <p>
        In the winter months, leopards sit in the front of their caves to take sunlight and return to their dwelling place in the night time only.

</p>
    <p>
        However, if you are looking for the best time to visit Bera, we recommend you to visit this wildlife sanctuary in the months between October-March as during these months the climatic conditions will be pleasant.&nbsp;</p>
