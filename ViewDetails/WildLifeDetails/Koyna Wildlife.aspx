        Koyna Wildlife Sanctuary thrives in a dense, green forest reserve situated in the heart of Satara district of Maharashtra.

</p>
    <p>
        The entire sanctuary spans an area of 423 square kilometers and ranges in elevations between 600 meters to 1000 meters of altitude. The sanctuary is nourished by several water bodies, amongst which rivers Kandati, Koyna and Solashi are primary water sources. A wide range of fauna have been found in the region and are protected by the government and forest development authority. Some of the most spectacular species found in Koyna Wildlife Sanctuary include Royal Bengal Tiger and King Cobra. In 2012, UNESCO declared Koyna Wildlife Sanctuary as a World Heritage site, considering the number of architectural findings in the area.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
        Koyna Wildlife Sanctuary is situated in a region with tropical monsoon climate, receiving heavy rains during monsoons. It is common for thunderstorms to occur during rainy weather. The insect population thrives during this time of the year along with the flora, which gets a chance to rejuvenate each monsoon. Summers continue from the month of March till the month of June. During May, the temperatures rise drastically, making the climate hot and dry. Most animals are seen near water bodies during this time of the year. Winters are cool with the lowest temperatures seen during the months of December and January.&nbsp;</p>

        <b>Best Time to Visit</b>
</p>
    <p>
Ideally the monsoon months between June and August are ideal for tourists to venture into the forests as the temperature is average and climatic conditions are stable. Heavy showers may be experienced durin these months but the observable density of the forest makes it worthwhile. October is the most stable time of the year as the weather is most predictable and pleasant to take trips during. November till March see the most amount of tourism in the year and are not ideal if one prefers to experience nature in exclusivity. The Sanctuary is open between 7:00am to 6:00pm for visitors.
