        The darkness of the night was gradually edging away, making room for a new dawn.

        I was just finalising just last minute arrangements for a week long trip to the 
        Andaman Islands when a friend who had been there recently, enquired curiously if 
        I was planning on visiting Havelock. I could sense the importance he attached to 
        that place. Havelock was a valuable addition to the long list of Andaman 
        attractions compiled by travel agencies. When we landed in Port Blair the 
        weather was splendid. The tropical climes and taste of salt in the air all added 
        to the charms of the islands. The next four days sped by before we even realised 
        it. The sun,sand,sea and surf all provided in genreous plenitude mesmerised us. 
        Embellishing this experience was a bit of history here (the Cellular Jail that 
        housed the British Raj&#39;s political prisoner) and a bit of adventure there ( 
        speed boating and scuba diving). But the curiosity that my friend had evoked 
        about Havelock Island, still remained to be satisfied. Understanding my anxiety, 
        Mr. Velusamy, the ever-smiling manager of our hotel, announced during dinner, &quot; 
        All arrangements made sir, you will be heading for Havelock tomorrow.&quot;</p>

        <b>Sailing away</b><span>&nbsp;</span>Havelock is one of 36 inhabited islands in the 
        Andaman and Nicobar archipelago, which consists of 572 islands. It is about 21 
        nautical miles away from Port Blair. Excitedly, I awoke early the next morning 
        and reached Phoenix Bay Jetty, the harbour for the Inter Island Shipping 
        Service. It resembled a busy local railway station or a city bus terminus during 
        peak hours. Children in uniforms with school bags, office goers rushing to their 
        workplaces, hawkers and a steady stream of tourists milled around in the chaotic 
        surroundings. We boarded the MV MUS, the big boat ferrying passengers between 
        Port Blair and Rangat, touching base with several islands en route. The boat 
        seemed overcrowded with more than 150 people as opposed to its capacity of 100 
        passengers. Around 25-30 foreign tourists carrying massive backpacks were 
        conspicuous in the crowd. The boat ride spanned about five hours and was a very 
        lively experience. We stood on the deck and watched the endless dark blue sea, 
        thrilled to spot a few dolphins and more than a dozen flying fish. Soft strains 
        of a flute accompanied our eager gaze as Mr Euve, a youngster from Switzerland, 
        tested out a skill acquired during his Indian sojourn. A co-passenger spiritedly 
        directed our attention to the fast approaching island of Havelock. The emerald 
        seashore beckoned; the magical draw of the island had captivated us already.</p>

        the islands</b><span>&nbsp;</span>The 10-minute drive from the jetty took us to 
        Dolphin Yatri Nivas, the state-run guesthouse. Situated amidst towering trees 
        and immaculate lawns, the cottages provided the wonderful views of the vast 
        greenish-blue expanse of sea, like refreshing ambrosia for the senses. After a 
        delicious meal, unable to resist the temptation, we hurried down to the 
        seashore. A few tourists having beaten us to the beach, were already knee deep 
        in water. My daughter discovered an entire range of delicate shells in different 
        shapes, sizes and colours that occupied her attention. My love for ornithology 
        got off to a flying start as I spotted a pair of multi-coloured kingfishers 
        nestling on a dense spread of mangroves. All in all, a delightful introduction 
        to Havelock Island! Come afternoon and we settled into the hotel&#39;s vehicle for 
        another pleasant journey. This 14-km long drive took us to the western side of 
        the island. We then stepped out on to Radhanagar beach, one of the most 
        beautiful in this part of the world. The gigantic trees stretched right up to 
        the shoreline, providing picturesque frames to the booming surf. The hotel had 
        made provisions for colourful tents for those who wished to loll on the beach. 
        We went for a long walk under the canopy of trees and switched over to stroll on 
        the spotless golden-white sands. A few fishing boats bobbed in the distant 
        horizon. Crabs made merry at my feet; a gentle breeze and the surf created by 
        the waves, all contributed towards an unforgettable experience. And then, the 
        ultimate sight that nature can offer: a brilliant sunset. The entire canvas of 
        sea and sky changed colours gradually. First,a golden yellow and thereafter, 
        patches of orange and maroon, and finally, an inky black engulfed everything. 
        Understandably, we were reluctant to leave this spectacular scene behind.</p>

        The magical spell wrought by Havelock had not yet been broken. A wake-up call 
        alerted us at five in the morning. In front of the Yatri Nivas, a different 
        canvas was unfolding. The darkness of the night was gradually edging away, 
        making room for a new dawn. Yesterday&#39;s emerald sea was transformed into a 
        crimson red as the sun appeared on the horizon. Except for the gentle rhythm of 
        the waves, a complete calm enveloped the surroundings. After breakfast, 
        explorations of the island continued. Tin and thatch roofed huts dotted the 
        village. The hilly slopes above these dainty little homes were being used to 
        cultivate banana and coconut palms. This patch of vegetation provided a vivid 
        splash of colour in contrast to the various hues of blue around. Oblivious to 
        the beauty of their surroundings, three children were returning home 
        nonchalantly with the early morning&#39;s catch of fresh seafood. By now, it was 
        time to move on. When we reached the jetty, a small crowd had already gathered. 
        We quenched our thirst with large gulps of sweet tender coconut water. The wait 
        was soon over and we boarded the boat for our journey back to the mainland. I 
        closed my eyes to recount stored memories, realising that a mere 24 hours had 
        passed by. Who could tell that a day in paradise could make a world of 
        difference I finally understood my friend&#39;s fascination for Havelock Island and 
        fully endorse this spectacular isle to other hedonists in search of a haven.</p>
