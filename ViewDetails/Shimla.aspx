       My, oh, my, Shimla, the place where you get to experience the Himalayas in all its enigmatic glory! Evergreen forests, rolling valleys, breathtaking lakes, pleasant climate, and colonial ambiance, all come together to lend this hill station a charm of its own. With a varied range of attractions – natural splendors as well as man-made wonders – the place truly lives up to its reputation. But there’s a downside to it. When you plan to visit this erstwhile summer capital of British India, you will have a tough time finalizing the list of places to visit.

     <p>The Ridge may well be defined as the heart of Shimla in terms of location and tourist attractions. This Shimla tourist spot is actually a wide-open street that runs along the Mall Road from east to west and connects it to the famous Scandal Point. What makes it such a popular destination is that it offers gorgeous views of the snow-capped mountain ranges that rise against the blue sky to border this paradise of a destination. The place is dotted with long-standing British establishments that beckon visitors to indulge in feel-good shopping and binge-eating. Lined with boutiques, bars, restaurants, cafes, and shops, the Ridge serves as the social hub in the region. Remember, this place is among the most photographed parts of the city, thanks to its rich natural beauty and the Gothic structures that define its exquisiteness.

            <p>Nestled within the Glen Forests, Chadwick Waterfall is one of the most delightful sights that nature has bestowed upon Shimla. The waterfall makes a dive from a height of 86 meters and cascades down a huge gorge. Surrounded by a blanket of greenery formed by the deodar and pine trees, it presents an enticing sight. The best time to visit it is during monsoons (from June to September) when the water level increases and Chadwick seems to take on a life of its own. If you are not daunted by the idea of taking a dip in the cold waters, you can go ahead and splash around.

    <p>Do you fancy visiting the historic location where the decision to create Pakistan and East Pakistan out of India was taken during the days running up to the country’s independence? Then you must trace your path to the Indian Institute of Advanced Study in Shimla. One of the iconic places to visit in Shimla and Manali, the building was initially built as a residence for Lord Dufferin, who served as the Viceroy of India from 1884 to 1888. At that time, it was known as the Viceregal Lodge and the impressive edifice had electricity connection in as early as 1888, which was way before the rest of Shimla came to use electric power in any form. After India gained independence, the place served as the summer retreat of the country’s president and was known as Rashtrapati Niwas before being turned into a center for advanced study and research. The structure draws attention due to its majestic Victorian style of architecture and grandeur.
