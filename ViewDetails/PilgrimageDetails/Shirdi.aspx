        Shirdi is famously known as the home of the late 19th century saint Shri Sai Baba.[1] The Shri Saibaba Sansthan Trust located in Shirdi is one of the richest temple organisations.[2] One of the most famous pilgrim centres of India, Shirdi is where Sai Baba, the saint known for his divine powers, lived and preached for over five decades. Samadhi Temple, where he lived, has a room that depicts articles and things used by Shri Sai during his lifetime, and is therefore quite significant for his disciples, who follow his teachings and rever him till date. The temple also houses his mortal remains.

</p>
    <p>
        Every day, over 60,000 tourists and devotees from all faiths and religions throng to the temple, and this number increases during festive seasons. The temple opens at 4:45 am[3] and one has to wait in a queue to get a glimpse of the idol and worship him. Other places related to the life of Shri Sai in Shirdi include Dwarkamayi Masjid, Chavadi and Gurusthan.

</p>
    <p>
        Dwarkamayi Masjid, which is a mosque with a temple inside, may be the only one 
        of its kind in India. Another interesting aspect of the mosque is that the 
        dhuni, or holy fire that Sai Baba allegedly lit here has been kept burning to 
        this day. The ash that falls from the dhuni is considered to have healing 
        powers.</p>

For 60 years Baba served mankind and preached his precious teachings to the world from here, and then went for contemplation (Samadhi) in Shirdi itself. The footprints and the deeds of Saibaba have turned this small town into a unique holy place for people of all castes, creeds and religions.

His message is being experienced till today. Shirdi is a convenient place to visit throughout the year, during all seasons. Baba's Shirdi is one place where even today all his devotees come with empty hands, but filled with Hope, and go back "Blessed with Contentment with an Everlasting Smile on their faces&nbsp;</p>
