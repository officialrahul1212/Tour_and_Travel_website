History & Legend of Tirupati Balaji Temple
Tirupati Balaji Temple
<b>History</b>

    <p>

The antiquity of the Tirupati Balaji Temple has been mentioned in several literary works and several sacred texts or Puranas such as Varaha Purana and Bavishyottara Purana. All the major dynasties who have ruled the Southern India such as Pallavas of Kancheepuram (9th Century), Cholas of Tanjore (10th Century), Pandyas of Madurai (14th Century) and the rulers of the Vijayanagar (14th and 15th Centuries)have been ardent devotees of Lord Venkateshwara and have made huge contributions and endowments to the temple.

    <p>
        In 1517, Vijayanagara Emperor Krishnadevaraya donated gold and jewels during his temple visits, thus enabling the main sanctum – Ananda Nilayam to be gilded.

<b>Legend of Tirumala Tirupati Temple</b>

    <p>
        During Kali Yuga, Rishis (Sages) were performing a Yajna (fire ritual) and were asked by Narada as to who will bear the fruit of the Yajna. They decided to send Sage Bhrigu to test the God Trinity to find out who is fit for the fruits of the sacred ritual. The sage had an extra eye in his feet. He visited Lord Brahma at Satyaloka and Lord Shiva at Kailasha and went un-noticed. Angered by this, he reached Lord Vishnu’s abode Vaikunta where Vishnu was lying on his snake bed (Adisesha) and Goddess Lakshmi was massaging his feet.

    <p>
        On seeing this, Sage Bhrigu got infuriated thinking that Vishnu was pretending to sleep to avoid him and kicked the Lord in his chest. Vishnu opened his eyes and pacified the sage by pressing his feet, thereby squashing his third eye. However, Lakshmi was furiously angry at the Sage for kicking Vishnu in his chest, where the Goddess resides and left Vaikunta.

    <p>
        Lord Vishnu bore the human form of Srinivasa in Tirumala Hills and married Padmavati, daughter of Akasaraja. On hearing this, Goddess Lakshmi reached Tirumala to question Vishnu about the wedding. It is told that Srinivasa turned into stone when he encountered by Lakshmi and Padmavati. They were insisted by Lords Brahma and Shiva to turn into stone as well, as their wish was to be with the Lord forever. Lakshmi stays on the left side of his chest and Padmavati on the right side.
