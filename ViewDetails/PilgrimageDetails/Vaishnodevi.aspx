        <b>Mythology of Mata Vaishno Devi Temple</b>

</p>
    <p>

Mata Vaishno Devi was born as Vaishnavi and was asked by the goddesses who created her to live on earth and spend her time attaining the high level of consciousness. She was then later directed by Lord Rama to set up an Ashram at the base of Trikuta Hills, meditate and grow spiritually; and she did as she was directed.

</p>
    <p>
        When the goddess started to stay in Trikuta Hills in Katra, Mahayogi Guru Goraksh Nathji sent his disciple, Bhairon Nath to test if the goddess had attained the higher level of spirituality yet. However, Bhairon Nath gradually lost the sense of purpose and fell in love with her, and started to annoy her to marry him.

</p>
    <p>
        In order to continue her Tapasya/meditation undisturbed, Vaishnavi fled to the mountains but was chased by Bhairon Nath. The goddess killed him and while dying, Bhairon Nath realized his mistake, and thus, asked for forgiveness. Mata Vaishno Devi not only forgave him but also granted him a boon. Each devotee performing a pilgrimage needs to have the Darshan of Bhairon after the goddess’; and only then would the Mata Vaishno Devi Yatra will be complete.&nbsp;</p>
