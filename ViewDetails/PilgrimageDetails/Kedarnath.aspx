        <b>About
Kedarnath Dham</b>
</p>
    <p>
Kedarnath Dham, located in the Rudraprayag district of Uttarakhand, is one of the most paramount locations for worshipers of Shiva. The air appears to be reverberating with the name of Lord Shiva amid the mighty snow-clad peaks, enchanting meadows and forests of the lower mountain range of Himalayas. Situated in a breathtaking location, near the source of Mandakini River and at the height of 3,584 meters, Kedarnath Dham celebrates the greatness of Lord Shiva. Kedarnath temple is one of the 12 Jyotir Lingams and is also the most important temple among the Panch Kedars (group of 5 Shiva temples in Garhwal Himalayas). It is also one of the significant temples of the sacred Chota Char Dham Yatra in Uttarakhand, raising the glory of the place to further heights.

</p>
    <p>
        Accessible from major destinations of Uttarakhand, the motorable road towards Kedarnath temple stretches till Gauri Kund. After that one needs to take a 14 km trek towards Kedarnath temple. Ponies and palanquins (doli) are easily available; one can also avail helicopter services during peak season of yatra.

</p>
    <p>
        The hard journey till the great shrine of Shiva is well compensated with the spiritual atmosphere which is created by the unruffled, tranquil and splendid beauty of the region. The majestic Kedarnath peak (6,940 meters) stands behind the temple along with other peaks, forming a perfect setting for the holy land of the supreme deity. The conical-shaped Shiva lingam in the Kedarnath temple is a unique feature of the temple among all Shiva shrines.&nbsp;</p>

       <b>History of Kedarnath Temple</b> 
</p>
    <p>
        <b>Kedarnath Temple's history is a testament to the power of devotion and faith.</b> </p>
    <p>

According to Hindu mythology, the temple was built by the Pandavas, the legendary heroes of the Hindu epic Mahabharata. As per legends, after the great Kurukshetra war, the Pandavas wanted to seek the blessings of Lord Shiva to atone for their sins. However, Lord Shiva was not pleased with them and refused to meet them. The Pandavas then followed him to the Himalayas, where he took refuge in the form of a bull. The Pandavas then built temples at the sites to worship Lord Shiva in his bull form where they found the body parts of the bull. Kedarnath Temple was the site where the hump of the bull was seen. The current temple is believed to have been built by Adi Shankara in the 8th century CE. However, the temple has undergone several renovations over the centuries due to damage caused by natural disasters such as earthquakes and avalanches. The current structure is believed to have been built in the 19th century.&nbsp;</p>
